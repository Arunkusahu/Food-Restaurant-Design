# FOOD RESTAURANT SERVICE

### Abouts

The existing Food Restaurant Service takes food orders manually. This creates errors and makes it difficult to process the orders. For this, we have integrated a system that will overcome the current manual ordering system. Our Food Order in restaurant will provide relevant food items that will be preferred by the user. client can access the menu which will be available. This will let client place orders with just a few clicks. We are also making use of an advanced wallet feature to help client pay for the food items..

If the person wants to order food, he/she can directly order the food from the website. This Food Order in website provides more comfort for the users in ordering the food. 

In this system, only designed by Front-end. This project is written by Html, CSS and Bootstrap.
